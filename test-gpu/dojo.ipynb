    "# Using Tensorflow GPU\n",
    "\n",
    "So, after searching for how to use Tensorflow with GPU (yeah for about 5 months now), unknowingly, since version 2.11, the tensorflow GPU native support for Windows is no longer available. Since I'm using Windows, I can't use Tensorflow GPU support. Instead, I need to install WSL, in which I do with [**Ubuntu**](). Here is the step-by-step to do this:\n",

    ">1. Install WSL if you haven't (Win 10 / 11)\n",
    "><br />\n",
    "><br />\n",
    ">2. Make sure you run `nvidia-smi` command in your WSL terminal. If it shows your GPU, continue with the next step. Otherwise, try to install your GPU driver, and repeat the step.\n",

    ">3. (I'm using Anaconda... So...) Installing Anaconda \n",
    "><br />\n",
    ">   I used to use this [link](https://www.how2shout.com/how-to/install-anaconda-wsl-windows-10-ubuntu-linux-app.html) \n",
    "><br />\n",
    ">   3.1 According to this link, run `wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2022.10-Linux-x86_64.sh`\n",
    "><br />\n",
    ">   3.2 Run the `sh` file with `./Anaconda3-2022.10-Linux-x86_64.sh`\n",

    "><br />\n",
    ">   3.3 Follow the instruction within the installation procedure\n",

    ">4. Use conda to install `pip jupyter ipykernel python=3.10`\n",
    "><br />\n",
    "><br />\n",
    ">5. After installed, run `pip install tensorflow[and-cuda]`\n",
    "><br />\n",
    "><br />\n",
    ">6. To use this environment in your Visual Studio Code, run Jupyter notebook backend by running `jupyter --port [the_port]` in your WSL. For example, `jupyter --port 55715`\n",
    "><br />\n",
    "><br />\n",
    ">7. In your Visual Studio Code, when selecting kernel, select *Another kernel*, and then select *Existing Jupyter Server*. Enter the URL of the running Jupyter server, like `http://localhost:55715`, after that, save its name. If you're asked for the password, check the WSL terminal, copy the token after the `token` as example below:\n",
    "><br />\n",
    "><br />\n",
    "> Hence the Jupyter link is `http://localhost:55713/tree?token=ae04e9abaa9f27036a4d19f230f8863f106ac9271dd446fe`\n",
